      <h5>Flexibility with Timing, Budget, and Location</h5>
      <br>
      <p>
        <br>
        We have a number of consultants available on a
        full-time basis, however, we know that full-time
        consultants aren’t always the right choice for an
        organization’s project or budget. That’s why we always
        strive to be flexible and accommodating. Below are a
        few of the ways that we can meet your specific needs.

          <h6>PART-TIME CONSULTANTS</h6>
          <p>Not all positions need to be full-time. You may find that you need someone with a highly specific skill set to work on a project only part-time. We can always find the right consultants to fit your specific requirements.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h6>ADVICE ON RETAINER</h6>
          <p>At times you just need a little impartial advice here and there, without the investment in a full-time consultant. We can put you in contact with the right person to answer your questions on an as-needed basis.

        </article>
        <article>
          <h6>REMOTE CONSULTANTS</h6>
          <p>When you need the job done right but don’t require a person in the office, we can find the right consultant at a lower cost if they work remotely.

          <h7>SHORT-TERM CONTRACT</h7>
          <p>Not every placement needs to be a 2 year contract. We recognize that many projects will require short-term work, and we are more than willing to collaborate with you to ensure the most flexible arrangement to fit your institution’s
            specific needs.
          </p>

          <h7>CUSTOM PROJECT SOLUTIONS</h7>
          <p>If you don’t see one solution that works for you, we are more than happy to work to fit your needs and create a fair arrangement that works for you—whether that means modifying an existing service, combining services, or having a
            consultant work on a trial-basis.
